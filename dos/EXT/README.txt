These are just some sample shutdown screens.  They look really bad,
but they are only to test the program "shutscrn".  The basic purpose
of that program is to fake a Microsoft Windows shutdown splash screen
under pure DOS mode, provided that you have the Windows 9x "logos.sys"
and "logow.sys" files.

util
====

This is my utilities repository... a collection of small miscellaneous
programs put all together in one place because they are not big enough
for their own repository and the like.  For the most part, these are
either toys or very simple tools.  Although many of them were
specifically written for Windows, and a few specifically written for
MS-DOS (via DJGPP), there still are a number of utilities that are
cross-platform.
